Prepare the pumpkin and butternut squash, if you have a sharp peeler, it actually works quite well to use it to remove the skins from the squash. Cube the pumpkin and squash flesh into 2-3” chunks.
Heat the oil in a large dutch oven or heavy soup pot, sauté onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.
Add the pumpkin, squash, curry, nutmeg, ginger, red pepper, salt and pepper and stock. Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until squash is tender and can be pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.
Puree the soup in a food processor or blender in small batches.
Once your soup is nice and creamy return it to the pot. Add your coconut milk, additional salt and pepper if needed and warm it back up over medium heat.
Serve with pumpkin seeds, a swirl of extra coconut milk, sliced jalapenos and a little cilantro. Enjoy!
